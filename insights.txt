Insights from the Data Set with Description:
1.Questions 8 and 7 were the hardest, while questions 4 and 1 were the easiest.

Method:Created a new dataframe consisting of all the mean scores for each question, and drew a barplot of scores for each question.

2.It was expected that the Faculty would perform better than the students(given) their knowledge and experience.However, the students performed better than faculty(and by a large amount)!! 

Method:Created a new data frame consisting of all the individual professions
 and mean scores of each group of people, and the barplot was drawn.


3.Tamil Nadu has the most number of toppers and the most number of uninterested people who didn’t even attempt any question

Method:A barplot was plotted for Toppers and uninterested people against their state of residence and both showed that Tamil Nadu had the highest

4.The 'other' people weren't very old; they were almost of the same age as the employed people.The faculty were the ‘oldest’ of the people who took the test.

Method:A KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) plot was drawn for graduation year of each of the groups of people.

5.Most of the people who took the test are young people
Among the young people, students were the greatest participators in this exam
However, there were some veterans indicated by the histogram(plotted between years 1950 and 2010). The graph is left-skewed because there are people who arent students who took the test .

Method: Both histogram and pie charts plotted confirmed that students formed the majority of the participants.
